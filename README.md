2anki Studio makes it fast and easy to create high-quality Anki flashcards offline. With drag-and-drop note and file conversion, you can build beautiful flashcards without technical skills or an internet connection.

**Key Features:**
- Offline flashcard creation
- Drag-and-drop notes or files for instant conversion
- Support for images, audio, and embeds
- Will enable bi-directional syncing with 2anki.net

This project is a companion to Anki and Notion, designed to streamline your learning workflow. It is not a replacement for Anki or Notion, but a bridge to make flashcard creation easier and more collaborative.

## How it works
- Toggle lists and note structures are converted into Anki cards.
- Customizable card types and cloze deletions supported.
